## Overview

This repository aims to provide a practical learning experience through detailed lab exercises. Each lab focuses on real-world scenarios, aiding in understanding complex network setups and configurations. The labs are categorized into sections for easy navigation and a structured learning approach.

## Lab Categories

### BGP Labs

In the `bgp` directory, you'll find labs related to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), one of the core routing protocols of the Internet. These labs range from basic setups to more advanced configurations.

- **01-basic-bgp**: An introductory series for BGP learners.
  - **arista-ceos**: Explore BGP on Arista cEOS.
  - **cisco-8k**: Advanced labs with Cisco 8000 Series, including automated Netconf scripts.
  - **cisco-csr1000v**: Cisco CSR1000V Series configurations.
  - **cumulus-frr**: BGP implementations on Cumulus Linux with FRRouting.
  - **juniper-vmx**: Hands-on labs with Juniper vMX routers.

### Service Provider Labs

The `service-provider` directory offers labs designed to mimic service provider network environments, providing insights into large-scale network operations.
